A sample AngularJS app showing Swedish Idol contestants.

## Technologies used
- AngularJS - web framework
- Jasmine - unit tests
- Protractor - integration tests
- Bootstrap CSS - CSS framework
- Git/Github - version control
- Bower - package manager
- Grunt - task manager

## Installation:
- git clone https://github.com/mariya/idol
- cd idol
- npm install
- npm start

## Execution
- Go to http://localhost:8000/
- Unit tests can be run through the browser at: http://localhost:8000/jasmine/SpecRunner.html
- Integration tests can be run from the CLI with: npm run protractor

## Todo's and Nice to Haves
- Implementation of the remaining unit tests
- Complete integration tests
- LESS or SASS CSS framework
- Use Grunt to minify CSS/JS
- Display remaining program information (teasers, copyright, sponsors, social media links etc.)
- Better design (responsive and mobile-friendly, of course)
- Cross-browser testing (frontend was tested on Chrome only)
- Improve code structure (jasmine, js and test are all top-level directories, could be better organized)
- Error handling
- Numbered pagination instead of just prev/next buttons
- Set up Karma test runner to run unit tests from the command line
- Animations on data load
- Add "active" class to current link in left nav
